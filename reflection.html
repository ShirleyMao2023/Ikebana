      <h1 class="w3-center">My <i>Ikebana</i> Journey</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">When I started the class, I knew nothing about flower arrangement. I remember during the first lesson we had, Gunji-sensei defined <i>ikebana</i> as a way where we make the flowers come alive again. It was such an interesting concept because when flowers are cut, they are dead. However through <i>ikebana</i>, we infuse life and new meaning to the flowers. In the beginning, making an arrangement was quite difficult. From choosing the plant materials to placing it in the vase, every step required lots of thought. As I made more arrangements, I felt myself improve. There were definitely some rocky moments in the middle, but the journey was rewarding.
        <br><br>
        I remember during the first class, I was unsure what to do and how to place the plant materials. My struggle was quite obvious from the unfortunate state of the wet foam in the end. While the state of my wet foam didn’t make great improvements, I was more confident as I got used to the black vase. Sometimes I would be inspired by a single flower and build my entire arrangement around it. Learning how to handle various plant materials also allowed me to shape the plants into forms that would go better with the arrangement. As we advanced to varying vases, it felt like going back to the beginning and relearning how to do everything. The hardest part was figuring out how I wanted to incorporate the vase. Overcoming this challenge was very rewarding because I learned so much about how to use wires to shape and secure my arrangement. I really like how my final arrangement turned out because it is an accurate depiction of my current mastery of <i>ikebana</i>. It makes me happy to see the amount of improvement I was able to make in a short period of time.
        <br><br>
        During the course of 8 weeks, I learned not only how to arrange flowers, but also key values of Japanese aesthetics that I never knew before. The first one is the beauty of minimalism. In western society, if there is a flower arrangement, a very big and full bouquet will be placed in the vase. However, in Japanese aesthetics, it’s better to have fewer varieties of plant material. It embodies the phrase “less is more”. By having less, we can clearly see the intent of an arrangement and appreciate every single component of the arrangement. Every single plant is essential and no plant is extra. I also learned to appreciate the beauty of asymmetry. This was very hard because I really like things to be organized in a symmetrical manner. Unconsciously, I would make an arrangement and realize that it is too symmetrical and boring. Asymmetric arrangement surprises the viewer and creates points of interest. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I learned a great deal about using seasonal plants. Flower arrangement should reflect upon the current season and we can often do so by going out and foraging for seasonal plants. It was really interesting to observe the change in seasons from the changes in the plants we were using. During the first few weeks, there were lots of sunflowers. However, as we shifted to autumn, we had red maple leaves and Japanese anemones. 
        <br><br>
        The core concepts I learned from <i>ikebana</i> is the idea of <i>ma</i> and <i>kokoro</i>. Sometimes, what isn’t there is more powerful than what is there. This is because <i>ma</i> is an area with endless potential and with our imagination, we can fill this space with anything. For example, in an arrangement, we can create <i>ma</i> by having branches coming out from one side but not the other. Viewers are able to speculate and interpret what they do not see. Perhaps, the empty side symbolizes the plants that have withered away to convey the idea of changing seasons. We can also create small arrangements and with a few lily grass, create lines above the arrangement. In the process, we create <i>ma</i> as well as visually expand the arrangement in a desired direction. Once we gained more experience arranging flowers, we learned how to begin with a theme and create an arrangement instead of the reverse order. We drew upon our <i>kokoro</i> for ideas. The concept of <i>kokoro</i> is quite philosophical. Even now, it is difficult for me to define. However, being in class helps me obtain a calm and relaxed <i>kokoro</i> and I can see it reflected in my arrangement.
        <br><br>
        As we conclude the course, I will definitely miss coming to Japan House every Monday to create flower arrangements. It is one of the few times in the week where I can feel relaxed and at peace. I believe many things I learned in this class can be utilized in my life. For example, I would definitely arrange flowers during my free time. Not only will I be able to relax while making it, but also the end product is visually pleasing to the eye. Since I have created a digital portfolio for my flower arrangements, I will also be able to update it periodically with new creations. One thing from this class I have yet to put to use is foraging my own plant materials. Sometimes I would see a pretty leaf or flower on the way to class. I always wonder if I am allowed to forage for those plants. Regardless, once I am back home, I look forward to foraging some plants in the garden to make <i>ikebana</i>. 
        <br><br>
        An important concept I can apply to my life is <i>ma</i>. Our current world is very fast paced and we are always busy with something. However, if I look back, I can’t recall anything too meaningful or interesting. It’s the same old cycle. Sometimes I need to pause, look around myself, and enjoy living the moment. It should be a no-brainer but it’s so easy to forget. While I should be very ambitious and do a lot of things, I want to be able to take a break and appreciate those around me. Since nothing lasts forever, I want to enjoy the moment while it lasts.
